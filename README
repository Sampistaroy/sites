Sites Plugin Version 0.1
------------------------------

This plugin enables multi-site support for Croogo (Original statement by the original author "rchavik"). This is an alternative version with a simpler and more comfortable GUI, some bugfixes and the possibility to choose a default site on your own. The default site represents the site that is going to be rendered in case there is no valid domain/subdomain/whatever specified.

On activation the database is automatically created and a default site is set up. Enjoy!

Configuration
-------------

1. Setup a new datasource named 'sites' in croogo database configuration.
   You can use the same physical database as croogo's, but 'sites' datasource
   needs to be present since all plugin models will use this.

   Eg:

		class DATABASE_CONFIG {
			var $default = array(
				'driver' => 'mysql',
				'database' => 'crogoo',
				...
				);

			var $sites = array(
				'driver' => 'mysql',
				'database' => 'crogoo',
				...
				);
		}

2. Activate the plugin
   Don't forget to cross your fingers.
